# Python Client

> Gradio Version 4.31.0

- The lightweight Gradio client libraries make it easy to use any Gradio app as an API.

- The Python client library is `gradio_client`.

- It's included in the latest versions of the `gradio` package, but for a more lightweight experience, you can install it using `pip` without having to install `gradio`:

    ```python
    pip install gradio_client
    ```

- The library mainly consists of two primary classes: `Client` and `Job`.
